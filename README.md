# Pokedex App

In this application I used
- ApolloJS
- React
- GraphQL

to build a small pokedex. 
I utilized the free GraphQL Pokemon server [here](https://graphql-pokemon.now.sh/)

In this application I have limited the results to the first 24 pokemon so the resources take forever to load, but I can change how many load by making a small change in the application.
